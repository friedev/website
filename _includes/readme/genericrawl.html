<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<pre><code class="language-sh">pip install genericrawl
</code></pre>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<pre><code class="language-sh">genericrawl
</code></pre>
<p>GeneriCrawl accepts no command line arguments.</p>
<h3 id="options">Options</h3>
<p>Game options are saved to <code>genericrawl&#47;options.json</code> in your system&#39;s default config location (<code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code>, <code>~&#47;.config</code>, or <code>%APPDATA%</code>).
Controls and colors can be changed in-game and automatically written back to this file.
However, if you want to change the screen size, you will need to manually edit this file with a text editor and set the values of <code>screen_width</code> and <code>screen_height</code>.
Each tile is 10 pixels, so the values 72 and 128 would produce a 720x1280 resolution, for instance.
Alternatively, you can enter fullscreen by pressing F11 in-game, which will automatically rescale the game to your screen size.</p>
<h3 id="controls">Controls</h3>
<p>GeneriCrawl comes with multiple common roguelike control schemes, as well as a less common left-handed control scheme.</p>
<h4 id="all-control-schemes">All Control Schemes</h4>
<p>The following bindings work in all of the following control schemes.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-</code>&#47;<code>=</code>: Change color scheme.</li>
<li><code>[</code>&#47;<code>]</code>: Change input scheme.</li>
<li><code>1</code>-<code>0</code>: Jump to an item in the inventory.
Note that these are the number row keys, not numbers on the number pad.</li>
<li>Space&#47;<code>.</code>: Wait one turn.</li>
<li>Space&#47;Enter: Select an item or location.</li>
<li><code>r</code>: If you&#39;re dead, restart the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also note that, for all movement schemes, you can press the center key to wait a turn.</p>
<h4 id="number-pad">Number Pad</h4>
