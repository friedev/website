	AsciiPanel Windowing Toolkit (APWT) is a set of classes and utilities that
	will make working with
	<a href="https://github.com/trystan/AsciiPanel">AsciiPanel</a> on a larger
	scale much easier. It includes support for screens, text windows,
	multicolored strings, and constants for different CP437 characters.
